# TerraForged for Rusticraft

An exact Rust translation of
[TerraForged](https://github.com/TerraForged/TerraForged), delivered as a stacked series of small
native-mod changes. This foundation ports the deterministic Noise2D primitives used by later terrain
modules. It intentionally does not alter world generation yet.

On top of them sit TerraForged's octave sources (Perlin, Perlin2, legacy simplex, improved simplex and
cubic) with their configuration, output bounds and the original explicit-seed behavior.

The ridged sources (Ridge, Billow and SimplexRidge) and the `Rand` white-noise source follow, including Engine's
quirks: `Rand.nextInt` divides by `range + range` (so it is almost always 0, and wraps for large ranges), and Engine
throws for ridged sources with more than 30 octaves, where this port keeps going.

The graph layer adds Engine's `Module` graph: constants, source nodes, the Abs, Alpha, Bias, Boost, Clamp, Invert, Map,
Power, Scale and Threshold modifiers and the Add, Multiply and Max combiners, with the shortcuts of Engine's builder
methods (`map`, `clamp`, `pow`, `bias`...). Its tests check the bounds each node reports as well as raw sample bits,
including Engine's quirks: Threshold reports its source's bounds rather than 0..1, and Max's minimum is the larger of
the first source's minimum and the other sources' maxima.

## Status: development only

This layer only adds the noise functions. It changes nothing in the game, so there is nothing for players to install
yet. Install instructions come with the layer that wires TerraForged into world generation.

## Development

The noise layer is ordinary Rust and can be tested without Minecraft resources. CI runs the same commands
(`.github/workflows/terraforged.yml`):

```sh
rustc --edition 2024 --test native-mods/terraforged/noise.rs -o /tmp/terraforged-tests
/tmp/terraforged-tests
```

The mixin pins Rusticraft commit `1b6e55d4f3bd14079551bcad173d0fac8f8225bb`, a `main` commit rather than a Nightly:
no Nightly is close enough (the nearest earlier one, `nightly-source/2026-10-31-d91cab6`, is 795 commits older and
`generator.rs` differs by 150 lines). The pin moves to a Nightly when the series is rebased onto one.

Translation inputs are TerraForged commit `6dd607ebfd41a3b7274e090b1f2cf565d53d1d44` and Engine 0.3.0 bytecode
shaded into the official `TerraForged-1.18.2-0.3.1-alpha-2.jar`. Tests compare raw `f32` bits with
values produced by those Java classes. The small Java programs that printed them run against that jar, so they stay
out of Git, in the maintainer's `.local/terraforged/oracles/` folder.
