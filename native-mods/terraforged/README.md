# TerraForged for Rusticraft

An exact Rust translation of
[TerraForged](https://github.com/TerraForged/TerraForged), delivered as a stacked series of small
native-mod changes. This foundation ports the deterministic Noise2D primitives used by later terrain
modules. It intentionally does not alter world generation yet.

On top of them sit TerraForged's octave sources (Perlin, Perlin2, legacy simplex, improved simplex and
cubic) with their configuration, output bounds and the original explicit-seed behavior.

The ridged sources (Ridge, Billow and SimplexRidge) and the `Rand` white-noise source follow, including Engine's
quirks: `Rand.nextInt` divides by `range + range` (so it is almost always 0, and wraps for large ranges), and Engine
throws for ridged sources with more than 30 octaves, where this port keeps going.

The graph layer adds Engine's `Module` graph: constants, source nodes, the Abs, Alpha, Bias, Boost, Clamp, Invert, Map,
Power, Scale and Threshold modifiers and the Add, Multiply and Max combiners, with the shortcuts of Engine's builder
methods (`map`, `clamp`, `pow`, `bias`...). Its tests check the bounds each node reports as well as raw sample bits,
including Engine's quirks: Threshold reports its source's bounds rather than 0..1, and Max's minimum is the larger of
the first source's minimum and the other sources' maxima. `Module::constant` is `Source.constant`, which returns its
shared `ZERO` for -0.0, so it samples +0.0.

The domain layer adds Engine's coordinate warps (`Domain.DIRECT`, `DomainWarp`, `DirectionWarp`, `AddWarp`,
`CompoundWarp` and `CumulativeWarp`) and the `Warp` module that samples its source at the warped point. Its tests check
raw bits, including Engine's quirks: `DirectionWarp` reads `NoiseUtil`'s 4096-entry sine table, `DomainWarp` maps a
constant axis to NaN, and `CumulativeWarp` returns the second warp's coordinate rather than its offset. `CacheWarp`
(`Domain.cache()`) is not ported: Engine never sets its `cached` flag, so it only passes samples through. The seed/scale
shorthands that build noise warps (`Domain.warp(seed, scale, octaves, strength)`, `Module.warp(seed, ...)`...) are not
ported yet either.

The selector layer adds Engine's `Base`, `Blend`, `VariableBlend` (`blendVar`) and `Select` modules, with the bounds
Engine reports for them: `Base` keeps its base's minimum and the larger maximum, the others the smaller minimum and
larger maximum of their two sources. Its tests check raw bits, including Engine's quirks: with a zero falloff `Select`
only picks its upper source above `upperBound`, and `Blend` fixes its blend window from the control's bounds when it is
built.

The multi-blend layer adds `MultiBlend` (`Module.blend(blend, sources...)`): it splits the control's 0..1 range into
one evenly spaced slot per source and blends neighbouring slots, with Engine's slot edges, `NoiseUtil.round` slot
lookup and reported bounds (the smallest minimum and largest maximum of the sources, 0 and 0 without sources). Where
Engine throws (a control far enough outside 0..1 to pick a slot that does not exist, or sampling a `MultiBlend` without
sources), this port panics.

The terrace layer adds `Terrace` (`Module.terrace(ramp, cliff, rampHeight, steps, blendRange)`): it clamps its source
to 0..0.999999 and snaps it to flat steps, rising to the next step through a ramp (scaled by `rampHeight`) and a cliff.
As in Engine, the steps are fixed when it is built and start at 0, not at the source's minimum, spaced by the source's
range over `steps - 1`; it reports the source's bounds. Where Engine throws (sampling a NaN, or a terrace with no
steps), this port panics.

The legacy terrace layer adds `LegacyTerrace` (`Module.legacyTerrace(lowerCurve, upperCurve, steps, blendRange)`): it
clamps its source to 0..1 and snaps it to the nearest of the same evenly spaced steps as `Terrace`, easing into the
neighbouring steps with Curve3 transitions whose height is scaled by `lowerCurve` (towards the next step) and
`upperCurve` (from the previous one); it reports the source's bounds. Its tests check raw bits against a Java oracle,
including Engine's quirks: a NaN sample rounds to the first step, and below the first step's window it returns that
step even when a blend range above 1 inverts the windows. Where Engine throws (sampling a legacy terrace with no steps),
this port panics.

The advanced terrace layer adds `AdvancedTerrace` (`Module.terrace(modulation, mask, slope, blendMin, blendMax, steps,
octaves)`): above `blendMin` it snaps its source to `steps * i` steps for each octave `i`, pulls each result back
towards the source by `slope`, adds `modulation` and divides by `modRange` (the source's maximum plus the modulation's,
fixed when it is built), then blends that in, fully above `blendMax` and scaled by `mask`; a zero mask or a sample at
or below `blendMin` returns the source sample unchanged. It reports the source's bounds. Its tests check raw bits
against a Java oracle, including Engine's quirks: zero steps turn every terraced sample into NaN, `steps * i` wraps
like Java's `int`, and a zero `modRange` divides by zero. Where Engine loops forever (`octaves` = `Integer.MAX_VALUE`), this port stops.

## Status: development only

This layer only adds the noise functions. It changes nothing in the game, so there is nothing for players to install
yet. Install instructions come with the layer that wires TerraForged into world generation.

## Development

The noise layer is ordinary Rust and can be tested without Minecraft resources. CI runs the same commands
(`.github/workflows/terraforged.yml`):

```sh
rustc --edition 2024 --test native-mods/terraforged/noise.rs -o /tmp/terraforged-tests
/tmp/terraforged-tests
```

The mixin pins Rusticraft commit `1b6e55d4f3bd14079551bcad173d0fac8f8225bb`, a `main` commit rather than a Nightly:
no Nightly is close enough (the nearest earlier one, `nightly-source/2026-10-31-d91cab6`, is 795 commits older and
`generator.rs` differs by 150 lines). The pin moves to a Nightly when the series is rebased onto one.

Translation inputs are TerraForged commit `6dd607ebfd41a3b7274e090b1f2cf565d53d1d44` and Engine 0.3.0 bytecode
shaded into the official `TerraForged-1.18.2-0.3.1-alpha-2.jar`. Tests compare raw `f32` bits with
values produced by those Java classes. The small Java programs that printed them run against that jar, so they stay
out of Git, in the maintainer's `.local/terraforged/oracles/` folder.
